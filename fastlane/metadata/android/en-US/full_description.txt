Fudge is an unofficial open-source re-implementation of Fujifilm's Camera Connect app. This is a very time consuming and experimental project, so the scope is limited to a basic image gallery, and image downloader.

*No bluetooth support. Will eventually be implemented, so stay tuned.*
Tested on X-A2 (2015) only, other cams have experimental implementations.
